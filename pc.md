## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

An open source distributed version control system. 

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

To be able to edit locally, isolating your changes and not impacting the main branch.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?

git checkout OR git switch, accompanied by branch name

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
git fetch- retrieves latest data from repo
git merge- essentially "un-forks" 2 or more branches
git pull- retrieves latest data AND copies from repo

7. What is a merge conflict?
The inability of Git to automatically resolve differences in merged branches

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
